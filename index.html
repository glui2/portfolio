            <p>
              My name is Gavin and I'm passionate about web development,
              particularly in the front-end space. I've worked on both a
              front-end development team and a back-end development team before,
              and have dabbled in different technologies in my own time. I'm
              super easy to get along with and am always eager to learn
              something new. Most recently, I have been familiarizing myself
              with React.js, but have also explored Vue.js and web dev using a
              CMS, with some back-end experience with Java and a few Python
              projects. Click the card to flip over and check out what I have
              been working on recently, or get in touch with me below!

              <p>
                This is a website that I developed in React for a fictional
                company. Users can input their contact details using a form,
                which validates and submits inputs to a mock API using Axios.

              <h4>Finzee App</h4>
              <p>
                I built the Finzee React app as part of the Finastra Hackathon,
                retrieving mock data using Finastra's supplied APIs. The goal
                was to create a centralized location where users can keep track
                of tax-claimable transactions.

              <h4>Church Roster App (WIP)</h4>
              <p>
                I have been working with another developer to build a
                centralised rostering platform for my church to use instead of
                using email communications. The front-end is currently being
                built with Typescript and React using Okta for user
                authentication.
